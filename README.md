    <a>Hey, Mr. Secrest wants me to close up shop or I'm getting ISS all this week. So, what I'm doing is moving the website. I hate to do this, but I have to, to keep me from getting out of trouble. I cannot tell you the website, and only I (Orion) will know it. I do, although, have something else. Stay tuned >:3</a>
